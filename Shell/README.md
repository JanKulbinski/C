Implementation of a simple version of the shell named lsh. Like the real shell, lsh reads the line from the standard input and searches the path from the PATH variable and executes the specified program with given arguments. If the line ends with the character (&), then lsh dosen’t wait until the command is finished and return immediately. Otherwise, the lsh wait for the program to execute. Program implements also ‘cd’ and ‘exit’ commands. Lsh finish its operation by pressing Control + D or by typing exit. Processes running in the background that have ended may become zombie to prevent that dobule-fork method was used.
